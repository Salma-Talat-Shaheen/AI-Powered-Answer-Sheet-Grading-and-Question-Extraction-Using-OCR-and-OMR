## `‚ú¶ Introduction`

In a digital world, simplifying data collection is essential. This **Questionnaire Analysis System** automates the process of scanning, detecting, and evaluating answers from filled-out questionnaires. 

Once the questionnaires are scanned and uploaded, the system automatically detects the marked answers, generates question IDs, and calculates results ‚Äî all without any manual input, saving time and reducing errors.

## `‚ú¶ Methodology`

### 1. Designing the Questionnaire
A multiple-choice questionnaire template was created. Users manually fill out the form by marking answers with a pen.

### 2.  Scanning & Preprocessing the Image
Once filled out, the form is scanned and saved as an image. The system preprocesses the image to enhance quality for better detection.

#### Preprocessing Steps:
- **Grayscale**: Simplifies the image.
- **Blurring**: Reduces noise.
- **Edge Detection**: Highlights the marked answers.
- **Orientation Correction**: Fixes any tilt or skew.

### 3.  Extracting Questions & Answers
- **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition) extracts text from the scanned image using `pytesseract`.
- Regular expressions are used to organize questions and answers.

### 4.  Answer Detection
Contours are detected to identify marked answers, then the answers are compared to a predefined key to calculate scores.

### 5.  Displaying Results
The answers are displayed in a table, showing which answers were correct, along with a score and feedback (e.g., "Great job!" or "Needs improvement").
